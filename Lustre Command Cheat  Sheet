1. To list OSTs
       #lfs osts
2. To take a full OST Offline
       #lctl dl --> [show the status of all file system components]
       #lctl --device 7 deactivate  --> [deactivate device no. 7]
3. To Activate an InActive OST Back Online
       #lctl --device 7 activate
POOL
4. To list available pools in fs
       #lfs pool_list temp         -->[temp is the name of filesystem]
5. To list OSTs in particular pool
       #lfs pool_list temp.newpool -->[temp is the name of filesystem]
                                      [newpool is the name of the pool]
6. To create new pool
       #lctl pool_new temp.newpool -->[temp is the name of filesystem]
                                      [newpool is the name of the newpool you want to create]
7. To add ost to pool
       #lctl pool_add temp.newpool temp-OST0001_UUID  -->[temp.newpool is the name of the pool]
                                                         [temp-OST0001_UUID is the name OST you want to add into the pool]
8. To remove ost from pool
       #lctl pool_remove temp.newpool temp-OST0001_UUUID  -->idem
9. To remove a pool
       #lctl pool_destroy temp.newpool      -->[pool must not contain any OSTs]
10. After deleteing an OST Pool, what happens to the files and directories in that pool?
    Files: *Retain their current stripe settings
           *Retain the pool name in the layout
    Directories: *Return to the file system's default stripe settings
11. If you want to use OST Pools, you must FULLY ENFORCE it
    Example1:    group0      /mnt/lustre
                 group1      /mnt/lustre/dir-for-pool-1
                 group2      /mnt/lustre/dir-for-pool-2
                 WILL NOT WORK AS EXPECTED, GROUP0 CAN WRITE TO ALL OSTS
    Example2:    group0      /mnt/lustre/dir-for-pool-0
                 group1      /mnt/lustre/dir-for-pool-1
                 group2      /mnt/lustre/dir-for-pool-2
                 FULL ISOLATION
13. Pool Rules
    * OST membership in a pool may be changed
    * An OST can be a member of multiple pools
    * No ordering of OSTs in a pool is defined
    * Striping (object allocation) within pools follows normal rules
    * OST pool seetings are effective only at file creation
14. To ASSIGN a directory to an OST Pool
    #mkdir -p /tier1/projectX
    #lfs setstripe -p temp.newpool tier1/projecX
15. To find which file exists in particular pool
    #lfs find --pool newpool /mnt/lustre
16. To find which file exists in particular ost
    #lfs find --obd temp-OST0001_UUID  /mnt/lustre
17. To display disk capacity usage of a pool
    #lfs df -p temp.newpool
