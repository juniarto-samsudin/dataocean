The lfs setstripe command is used to dictate a particular striping configuration for a file or directory. 

For a file, setstripe:
gives an error if the file already exists (see Note below),else it creates an empty file with the desired stripe settings.

Using setstripe on a directory:
*changes the stripe settings for the directory,
*any file subsequently created in the directory will inherit those settings,
*does not affect existing files in directory.

Note: 
Once a file has been written to Lustre with a particular stripe configuration, you cannot simply use setstripe to change it. The file must be re-written with a new configuration. Generally, if you need to change the striping of a file, you can do one of two things:

*using setstripe, create a new, empty file with the desired stripe settings and then copy the old file to the new file, or
*setup a directory with the desired configuration and cp (not mv) the file into the directory


The options for lfs setstripe are:

-c to set the stripe count; 0 means use the system default (usually 1) and -1 means stripe over all available OSTs (up to the system-inherent limit of 160)
-s to set the stripe size; 0 means use the system default (usually 1 MB) otherwise use k, m or g for KB, MB or GB respectively


For example to configure the (existing) directory bigdir for holding very large files, we could set its stripe count to 50 and stripe size to 32 MB with:

> lfs setstripe -c 50 -s 32m bigdir
