We are going to create a 10 G file. either using dd, fallocate or truncate.
a. dd if=/dev/zero of=tengigfile bs=1M count=10240
b. fallocate -l 10G tengigfile
   to addd additional 10 more gigs to the end of the tengigfile
   fallocate -o 10G -l 10G tengigfile
   where -o is the offset, or the start point of the fallocate
c. truncate -s 10G tengigfile
   to add additional 10 more gigs to the end of the tengigfile
   truncate -s +10G tengigfile

Usually you want to make convert this empty file into block device

losetup /dev/loop0 /root/tengigfile, where tengigfile is the file you have just 
created above

or

create your own /dev/fake-dev0
   mknod /dev/fake-dev0  b 7 200
   where 7 is the major number of loop device driver, grep loop /proc/devices

If you want it to be remounted after machine reboot
   in /etc/rc.local, add the followings:
        losetup /dev/loop0  /root/tengigfile
